# Guidelines for Organizing the Project Folder

To keep our project folder neat, organized, and easy for everyone to use, please follow these guidelines:

---

## 1. Create a Clear Folder Structure

- **Main Folders**: Organize the folder into main sections such as:
  - **Documentation**
  - **4 Blocker**
  - **Sample Data**
  - **Code**
  - **Executables**
  - **Resources**

- **Subfolders**: Use subfolders within each main folder to further categorize content if needed.

- **Avoid Too Many Layers**: Keep the folder hierarchy shallow to make navigation simple.

---

## 2. Use Consistent Naming Conventions

- **Descriptive Names**: Name files and folders clearly to reflect their content (e.g., `Project_Plan.pdf`, `User_Guide.docx`).

- **Date Format**: If including dates, use the format `YYYY-MM-DD` (e.g., `Meeting_Notes_2023-10-15.docx`).

- **Avoid Special Characters**: Stick to letters, numbers, underscores `_`, and hyphens `-`. Avoid spaces and special symbols.

---

## 3. Maintain Version Control

- **Version Numbers**: Add version numbers to file names for documents that get updated frequently (e.g., `Report_v1.0.docx`, `Report_v1.1.docx`).

- **Use Box Features**: Utilize Box's built-in version history instead of saving multiple versions when possible.

---

## 4. Keep Documentation Up-to-Date

- **README File**: Include a `README` file at the top level explaining the folder structure and contents.

- **Regular Updates**: Ensure all documents, especially the "4 Blocker," are current and reflect the latest project status.

---

## 5. Set Appropriate Access Permissions

- **Organization-Wide Access**: Confirm that permissions allow everyone in the organization to view and download files.

- **Sensitive Information**: If certain files are confidential, place them in a secured subfolder with restricted access.

---

## 6. Standardize File Formats

- **Common Formats**: Use universally accessible formats like PDF for documents, CSV for data files, and executable formats compatible with common operating systems.

- **Avoid Proprietary Formats**: Do not use file types that require special software unless necessary.

---

## 7. Enhance Searchability

- **Include Keywords**: Use relevant keywords in file names and within documents to make them easier to find.

- **Tags and Descriptions**: Use Box's tagging feature to add metadata to files, aiding in search.

---

## 8. Prevent Duplication

- **Single Copy**: Store only one copy of each file to avoid confusion.

- **Use Shortcuts**: If a file needs to appear in multiple folders, create a shortcut instead of copying the file.

---

## 9. Archive Old Materials

- **Archive Folder**: Move outdated or unused files to an `Archive` folder.

- **Date Archived**: Note the date when files are archived for future reference.

---

## 10. Regularly Review and Clean Up

- **Periodic Checks**: Schedule times to review the folder contents and remove unnecessary files.

- **Team Effort**: Encourage everyone to keep the folder tidy by following these guidelines.

---

## 11. Ensure Simplicity and Clarity

- **Plain Language**: Use simple, clear language that everyone can understand, regardless of their technical background.

- **Avoid Jargon**: Refrain from using technical terms without explanations.

---

## 12. Backup Important Data

- **Regular Backups**: Keep backups of critical files in a secure location.

- **Backup Log**: Maintain a log detailing what was backed up and when.

---

By following these guidelines, we'll create a well-organized project folder that is easy to navigate and understand for everyone in the organization. This will help all team members quickly find the information they need and stay informed about the project's progress.
