# How to Export a Salesforce Report as CSV in UTF-8

## Step 1: Log in to Salesforce
1. Open your web browser and log in to your Salesforce account.

## Step 2: Navigate to Reports
1. From the Salesforce dashboard, click on the **App Launcher** (the grid icon) located at the top-left corner.
2. Type "Reports" into the search bar and select **Reports** from the list.

## Step 3: Select or Create a Report
1. Browse through the list of existing reports or use the search bar to find the specific report you want to export.
2. If you need to create a new report, click on the **New Report** button and follow the steps to generate your report.

## Step 4: Run the Report
1. Once you've selected or created the report, click on the **Run** button to generate the report with the most current data.

## Step 5: Export the Report
1. After the report is generated, click on the **Export** button located at the top-right corner of the report window.
2. In the Export Report dialog box:
   - Select **Formatted Report** or **Details Only** depending on your preference (for CSV, you typically choose "Details Only").
   - Under the **Format** section, choose **Comma Delimited .csv**.

## Step 6: Save the File in UTF-8 Format
1. Before clicking the **Export** button, ensure that the **Include UTF-8 BOM** option is selected (if available).
   - Some versions of Salesforce automatically export in UTF-8 format. However, if this option is available, it ensures proper encoding.
2. Click on **Export** to download the report.
3. Choose the location on your computer where you want to save the file and ensure the file extension is `.csv`.

## Step 7: Verify the Encoding (Optional)
1. If you're unsure whether the file is in UTF-8 format, you can open the file in a text editor like Notepad++ or Sublime Text.
2. Check the encoding from the editor's menu to verify that it is UTF-8.

## Step 8: Use the CSV File
1. Your Salesforce report is now exported as a CSV file in UTF-8 format, ready to be used or shared.
