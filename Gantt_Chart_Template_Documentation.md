## 1. Understanding the Template Layout

- **Header Information**: 
  - The top rows include metadata such as the Project Name, Company Name, Project Start Date, and Project Lead. These should be filled out initially to customize the Gantt chart for your specific project.

- **Task List**:
  - Below the metadata, there are columns likely dedicated to tasks, their start and end dates, durations, and progress tracking.

## 2. Adding a Task

1. **Locate the Task Row**: 
   - Scroll down to the section where tasks are listed. Each row represents a task.
   
2. **Input Task Information**:
   - **Task Name**: Enter the name of the task in the first available column labeled for tasks (e.g., “Task Name” or similar).
   - **Start and End Dates**: Input the start and end dates of the task in the corresponding columns.
   - **Duration**: Enter the duration of the task, if applicable. This might auto-calculate based on start and end dates.
   
3. **Assign Resources**:
   - If there are columns for resource allocation (e.g., who is responsible for the task), fill in this information accordingly.

## 3. Adding Subtasks

1. **Indent the Task**:
   - To create a subtask, add a new row below the main task and indent it slightly (if the template supports it), indicating it’s a subtask.
   
2. **Enter Subtask Details**:
   - Input the subtask name, start date, end date, and duration just like you did for the main task.

## 4. Tracking Progress

1. **Completion Status**:
   - There might be a column dedicated to progress tracking (e.g., "% Complete"). Enter the percentage of completion for each task as the project progresses.
   
2. **Color Coding**:
   - The Gantt chart may use conditional formatting to visually indicate progress. As you update the completion percentage, the corresponding bar in the Gantt chart might automatically adjust its color or length to reflect progress.

## 5. Editing the Tracker

1. **Update Dates**:
   - If any tasks' dates change, simply update the start or end dates in the corresponding columns. The Gantt chart should auto-update to reflect these changes.
   
2. **Adjusting Durations**:
   - If the task duration changes due to unforeseen circumstances, update the duration column. The dates and Gantt bars may adjust accordingly.

3. **Adding Additional Columns**:
   - If your project requires additional data tracking, you can insert new columns for details like task priority, dependencies, or additional notes.

## 6. Visualizing Completion

- The Gantt chart will visually represent your tasks over time, with bars corresponding to the timeline of each task.
- As you update progress, the chart will dynamically adjust, providing a visual summary of your project’s status.

By following these steps, your team can effectively use the Gantt chart template to manage tasks, subtasks, and track progress visually. The template is designed to auto-update and provide real-time visual feedback as project details are inputted and edited.
